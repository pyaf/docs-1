## Installation

Deep Agents is available as a standalone Python library:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install deepagents
```

```bash uv
uv add deepagents
```

```bash poetry
poetry add deepagents
```
</CodeGroup>

## Prerequisites

Deep Agents requires:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- LangGraph (installed automatically as a dependency)

## API keys

To use Deep Agents, you'll need an API key from a model provider. Deep Agents supports any model provider that works with LangChain, including:

- **Anthropic**: Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- **OpenAI**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Google**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Other providers**: See [LangChain integrations](/oss/python/python/integrations/providers/overview)

## Verify installation

You can verify your installation by creating a simple agent:

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    tools=[]
)

print("Deep Agents installed successfully!")
```
