description: Build your first deep agent in minutes
---

This guide will walk you through creating your first deep agent with planning, file system tools, and subagent capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Installed the deepagents library ([installation guide](/oss/python/deepagents/install))
- An API key from a model provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI)
- Python 3.9 or higher

## Build a research agent

Let's build a research agent that can conduct thorough research and write polished reports.

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install deepagents tavily-python
```

### Step 2: Set up your API keys

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key"
```

### Step 3: Create a search tool

```python
import os
from typing import Literal
from tavily import TavilyClient
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key=os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"])

# Search tool to use to do research
def internet_search(
    query: str,
    max_results: int = 5,
    topic: Literal["general", "news", "finance"] = "general",
    include_raw_content: bool = False,
):
    """Run a web search"""
    search_docs = tavily_client.search(
        query,
        max_results=max_results,
        include_raw_content=include_raw_content,
        topic=topic,
    )
    return search_docs
```

### Step 4: Create your deep agent

```python
# System prompt to steer the agent to be an expert researcher
research_instructions = """You are an expert researcher. Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.

You have access to an internet search tool.

## `internet_search`
Use this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.
"""

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    tools=[internet_search],
    system_prompt=research_instructions
)
```

### Step 5: Run your agent

```python
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is LangGraph?"
    }]
})

# Print the agent's response
print(result["messages"][-1].content)
```

## What just happened?

Your deep agent automatically:

1. **Planned its approach** - Used the built-in `write_todos` tool to break down the research task
2. **Conducted research** - Called the `internet_search` tool to gather information
3. **Managed context** - Used file system tools (`write_file`, `read_file`) to offload large search results
4. **Spawned subagents** (if needed) - Delegated complex subtasks to specialized subagents
5. **Synthesized a report** - Compiled findings into a coherent response

## Next steps

Now that you've built your first deep agent, you can:

- **Customize your agent** - Learn about [customization options](/oss/python/deepagents/customization) including custom system prompts, tools, and subagents
- **Understand middleware** - Dive into the [middleware architecture](/oss/python/deepagents/middleware) that powers deep agents
- **Add long-term memory** - Enable [persistent memory](/oss/python/deepagents/customization#long-term-memory) across conversations
- **Deploy to production** - Learn about [deployment options](/oss/python/langgraph/deploy) for LangGraph applications
