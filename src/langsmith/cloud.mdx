The **Cloud** option is a fully managed hosting model where LangChain hosts and operates all LangSmith infrastructure and services. This is the fastest way to get started with LangSmith.

## What you get

- **Fully managed infrastructure**: LangChain handles all infrastructure, updates, scaling, and maintenance
- **Deploy from GitHub**: Connect your repositories and deploy with a few clicks
- **Automated CI/CD**: Build process is handled automatically by the platform
- **LangSmith UI**: Full access to observability, evaluation, deployment management, and Studio

|                   | **Who manages it** | **Where it runs** |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **LangSmith platform (UI, APIs, datastores)** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |
| **Your LangGraph Servers** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |
| **CI/CD for your apps** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |

## Get started

To deploy your first application to Cloud, follow the [Cloud deployment quickstart](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart) or see the [comprehensive setup guide](/langsmith/deploy-to-cloud).

## When to choose Cloud

**Choose Cloud if:**
- You want the fastest setup with no infrastructure management
- You're comfortable with your data and compute in LangChain's cloud
- You want automatic updates and scaling
- You prefer a fully managed solution

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You need data residency in your own cloud → See [Hybrid](/langsmith/hybrid)
