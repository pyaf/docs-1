title: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using LangSmith Deployments and Evaluation
sidebarTitle: Implement a CI/CD pipeline
---

This guide demonstrates how to implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for AI agent applications deployed in LangSmith Deployments. In this example, we are using our open source framework [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview) for orchestrating and building the agent, [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) for observability and evaluations. This pipeline is based on the [cicd-pipeline-example repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/cicd-pipeline-example).

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline provides:

- <Icon icon="check-circle" /> **Automated testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- <Icon icon="chart-line" /> **Offline evaluations**: Performance assessment using [AgentEvals](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals), [OpenEvals](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) and [LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/home)
- <Icon icon="rocket" /> **Preview and production deployments**: Automated staging and quality-gated production releases using the Control Plane API
- <Icon icon="eye" /> **Monitoring**: Continuous evaluation and alerting

## Pipeline architecture

The CI/CD pipeline consists of several key components that work together to ensure code quality and reliable deployments:

```mermaid

    A1[Code or Graph Change] --> B1[Trigger CI Pipeline]
    A2[Prompt Commit in PromptHub] --> B1
    A3[Online Evaluation Alert] --> B1
    A4[PR Opened] --> B1

    subgraph "Testing"
        B1 --> C1[Run Unit Tests]

    subgraph Manual Review
        J1 --> M1[Human Labeling]
        M1 --> J3
    end
```

### Trigger Sources

There are multiple ways you can trigger this pipeline, either during development or if your application is already live. The pipeline can be triggered by:

- <Icon icon="code-branch" /> **Code Changes**: Pushes to main/develop branches where you can modify the LangGraph architecture, try different models, update agent logic, or make any code improvements
- <Icon icon="edit" /> **PromptHub Updates**: Changes to prompt templates stored in LangSmith PromptHub - whenever there's a new prompt commit, we trigger a webhook to run the pipeline
- <Icon icon="exclamation-triangle" /> **Online Evaluation Alerts**: Performance degradation notifications from live deployments
- <Icon icon="webhook" /> **LangSmith Traces Webhooks**: Automated triggers based on trace analysis and performance metrics
- <Icon icon="play" /> **Manual Trigger**: Manual initiation of the pipeline for testing or emergency deployments

### Testing Layers

Compared to more traditional software, testing AI agent applications includes assessing the quality of the agent responses and therefore it is essential to evaluate each part of the workflow. The pipeline implements multiple testing layers:

1. <Icon icon="puzzle-piece" /> **Unit Tests**: Individual node and utility function testing
2. <Icon icon="link" /> **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
3. <Icon icon="route" /> **End-to-End Tests**: Full graph execution testing
4. <Icon icon="brain" /> **Offline Evaluations**: Performance assessment with real-world scenarios including end-to-end evaluations, single-step evaluations, agent trajectory analysis, and multi-turn simulations
5. <Icon icon="server" /> **LangGraph Dev Server Tests**: We use our [langgraph-cli](/langsmith/cli) tool for spinning up (inside the GitHub Action) a local server to run the LangGraph agent. We poll the `/ok` server API endpoint until it is available and for 30 seconds, after that we throw an error

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have:

- <Icon icon="robot" /> An AI agent application (in this case built using [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview))
- <Icon icon="key" /> [LangSmith account](/langsmith/create-account-api-key) and API key needed to deploy agents and retrieve experiment results
- <Icon icon="cog" /> Additional environment variables configured in your repository secrets

<Note>
While this example uses GitHub, the CI/CD pipeline works with other Git hosting platforms including GitLab, Bitbucket, and others.
</Note>

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline leverages GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process, utilizing the [Control Plane API](/langsmith/api-ref-control-plane) and [LangSmith API](/langsmith/api-reference) for seamless integration. The implementation includes a comprehensive helper script available at [https://github.com/langchain-ai/cicd-pipeline-example/blob/main/.github/scripts/langgraph_api.py](https://github.com/langchain-ai/cicd-pipeline-example/blob/main/.github/scripts/langgraph_api.py) that facilitates API interactions and deployment management.

### New Agent Deployment

When we open a PR and tests pass, we create a new preview deployment in LangSmith Deployments using the [Control Plane API](/langsmith/api-ref-control-plane). This allows us to test the agent in a staging environment before promoting to production.

### Agent Deployment Revision

![Agent Deployment Revision Workflow](./images/cicd-new-lgp-revision.png)

A revision happens when we find an existing deployment with the same ID, or when we merge the PR into main. In the case of merging to main, we delete the preview deployment and create a production deployment. This ensures that any updates to the agent are properly deployed and integrated into the production infrastructure.

### Testing and Evaluation Workflow

![Test with Results Workflow](./images/cicd-test-with-results.png)

In addition to the more traditional testing phases (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, etc.), we have added offline evaluations and LangGraph dev server testing because we want to test the quality of our agent. These evaluations provide comprehensive assessment of the agent's performance using real-world scenarios and data.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Final Response Evaluation" icon="check-circle">
    Evaluates the final output of your agent against expected results. This is the most common type of evaluation that checks if the agent's final response meets quality standards and answers the user's question correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Single Step Evaluation" icon="step-forward">
    Tests individual steps or nodes within your LangGraph workflow. This allows you to validate specific components of your agent's logic in isolation, ensuring each step functions correctly before testing the full pipeline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent Trajectory Evaluation" icon="route">
    Analyzes the complete path your agent takes through the graph, including all intermediate steps and decision points. This helps identify bottlenecks, unnecessary steps, or suboptimal routing in your agent's workflow. It also evaluates whether your agent invoked the right tools in the right order or at the right time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Turn Evaluation" icon="comments">
    Tests conversational flows where the agent maintains context across multiple interactions. This is crucial for agents that handle follow-up questions, clarifications, or extended dialogues with users.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

See the [LangGraph testing documentation](/oss/python/langgraph/test) for specific testing approaches and the [evaluation approaches guide](/langsmith/evaluation-approaches) for a comprehensive overview of offline evaluations.

## Deployment Options

We support multiple deployment methods, mostly based on the LangSmith instance you have:

- <Icon icon="cloud" /> **Cloud LangSmith**: Direct GitHub integration or Docker image deployment
- <Icon icon="server" /> **Self-Hosted/Hybrid**: Container registry-based deployments

The deployment flow starts by modifying your agent implementation. At minimum, you must have a `langgraph.json` and dependency file in your project (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`). We use the `langgraph dev` CLI tool to check for errors - if there are any, we fix the issues; otherwise, the deployment will likely succeed when deployed to LangSmith Deployments.

### Prerequisites for Manual Deployment

Before deploying your agent, ensure you have:

1. <Icon icon="project-diagram" /> **LangGraph Graph**: Your agent implementation (e.g., `./agents/simple_text2sql.py:agent`)
2. <Icon icon="box" /> **Dependencies**: Either `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with all required packages
3. <Icon icon="cog" /> **Configuration**: `langgraph.json` file specifying:
   - Path to your agent graph
   - Dependencies location
   - Environment variables
   - Python version

Example `langgraph.json`:
```json
{
    "graphs": {
        "simple_text2sql": "./agents/simple_text2sql.py:agent"
    },
    "env": ".env",
    "python_version": "3.11",
    "dependencies": ["."],
    "image_distro": "wolfi"
}
```

### Method 1: LangSmith Deployment UI (Cloud Only)

Deploy your agent using the LangSmith deployment interface for cloud deployments:

1. Go to your LangSmith dashboard
2. Navigate to the Deployments section
3. Connect your GitHub repository and specify the agent path

<Info>
**Benefits:**
- Simple UI-based deployment
- Direct integration with your GitHub repository
- No manual Docker image management required
</Info>

### Method 2: Build Docker Image with LangGraph CLI

Build a Docker image directly using the LangGraph CLI:

```bash
# Build Docker image
langgraph build -t my-agent:latest

# Push to your container registry
docker push my-agent:latest
```

You can push to any container registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Azure ACR, Google GCR, etc.) that your deployment environment has access to.

**Deployment Options:**
- **Cloud LangSmith**: Use the Control Plane API to create deployments from your container registry
- **Self-Hosted/Hybrid LangSmith**: Choose between LangSmith UI or Control Plane API

See the [LangGraph CLI build documentation](/langsmith/cli#build) for more details.

### Local Development & Testing

![LangGraph Studio CLI Interface](./images/cicd-studio-cli.png)

First, test your agent locally using LangGraph Studio:

```bash
# Start local development server with LangGraph Studio
langgraph dev
```

This will:
- Spin up a local server with LangGraph Studio
- Allow you to visualize and interact with your graph
- Validate that your agent works correctly before deployment

<Tip>
If your graph works in LangGraph Studio, deployment to LangSmith will likely succeed.
</Tip>

See the [LangGraph CLI documentation](/langsmith/cli#dev) for more details.

### Deploy to LangSmith

#### Cloud Deployment

![Cloud LangSmith Deployment UI](./images/cicd-cloud-lgp.png)

Deploy using the LangSmith deployment UI or the [Control Plane API](/langsmith/api-ref-control-plane#langgraph-control-plane-api-reference):

- **UI Method**: Connect your GitHub repository directly in the LangSmith UI
- **API Method**: Use the Control Plane API to create deployments from your container registry (required for Docker images)

#### Self-Hosted/Hybrid Deployment

![Self-Hosted LangSmith Deployment UI](./images/cicd-selfhosted-lgp.png)

For [self-hosted LangSmith instances](/langsmith/deploy-self-hosted-full-platform):

1. Ensure your Kubernetes cluster has access to your container registry
2. Build and push your Docker image to your container registry
3. Choose your deployment method:
   - **LangSmith UI**: Create a new deployment and specify your image URI (e.g., `docker.io/username/my-agent:latest`)
   - **Control Plane API**: Use the API to create deployments from your container registry

<Note>
Self-hosted deployments don't distinguish between development/production types, but you can use tags to organize them.
</Note>

See the [self-hosted full platform deployment guide](/langsmith/deploy-self-hosted-full-platform) for detailed setup instructions.

### Connect to Your Deployed Agent

Once your agent is deployed, you can connect to it using several methods:

- <Icon icon="code" /> **[LangGraph SDK](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/sdk/python_sdk_ref/#langgraph-sdk-python)**: Use the LangGraph SDK for programmatic integration
- <Icon icon="project-diagram" /> **[RemoteGraph](/langsmith/use-remote-graph)**: Connect using RemoteGraph for remote graph connections (to use your graph in other graphs)
- <Icon icon="globe" /> **[REST API](/langsmith/server-api-ref)**: Use HTTP-based interactions with your deployed agent
- <Icon icon="desktop" /> **[LangGraph Studio](/langsmith/studio)**: Access the visual interface for testing and debugging

### Environment Configuration

#### Database & Cache Configuration

By default, LangSmith Deployments create PostgreSQL and Redis instances for you. To use external services, set the following environment variables in your new deployment or revision:

```bash
# Set environment variables for external services
export POSTGRES_URI_CUSTOM="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"
export REDIS_URI_CUSTOM="redis://host:6379/0"
```

See the [environment variables documentation](/langsmith/env-var#postgres-uri-custom) for more details.

#### Required Environment Variables

Remember to add all necessary environment variables to your deployment, including any API keys required by your specific agent implementation.

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong API Endpoints

If you're experiencing connection issues, verify you're using the correct endpoint format for your LangSmith instance. There are two different APIs with different endpoints:

#### LangSmith API (Traces, Ingestion, etc.)

For LangSmith API operations (traces, evaluations, datasets):

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| US | `https://api.smith.langchain.com` |
| EU | `https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com` |

For self-hosted LangSmith instances, use `http(s)://<langsmith-url>/api` where `<langsmith-url>` is your self-hosted instance URL.

<Note>
If you're setting the endpoint in the `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` environment variable, you need to add `/v1` at the end (e.g., `https://api.smith.langchain.com/v1`).
</Note>

#### LangSmith Deployments API (Deployments)

For LangSmith Deployments operations (deployments, revisions):

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| US | `https://api.host.langchain.com` |
| EU | `https://eu.api.host.langchain.com` |

For self-hosted LangSmith instances, use `http(s)://<langsmith-url>/api-host` where `<langsmith-url>` is your self-hosted instance URL.
